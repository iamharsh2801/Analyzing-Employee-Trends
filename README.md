# Analyzing-Employee-Trends

1. Job Satisfaction Analysis:

Education Field & Avg. Job Satisfaction: A combined bar and line chart explores the correlation between an employee's field of education and their average job satisfaction. The bars represent the number of employees in each education field (e.g., Human Resources, Life Sciences, Marketing, Medical, Technical Degree), while the line shows the average job satisfaction score for that field. This visualization helps identify which education backgrounds tend to report higher or lower job satisfaction.
Overall Job Satisfaction Measurement: While not directly visualized in the image, the "Measure Names" section suggests that "Avg. Job Satisfaction" is a key metric tracked within the dashboard. This indicates that the project aims to understand and potentially improve overall employee satisfaction.

2. Demographic Analysis:

Department: A horizontal bar chart shows the distribution of employees across different departments (R&D, Sales, HR). This provides a snapshot of the company's structure and employee allocation.
Gender: A pie chart displays the gender breakdown of the employee population. This helps understand the gender balance within the organization.
Marital Status: The "Marital Status" section (Divorced, Married, Single) suggests that the analysis includes how marital status might relate to other factors, potentially including job satisfaction or travel frequency. Visualizations for this aspect are not shown in the image.
Type of Degree: A treemap (or similar hierarchical chart) visualizes the distribution of employees based on their degree type (Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree, Associates Degree, High School). The size of each block represents the proportion of employees holding that degree.

3. Travel Analysis:

Travel: A horizontal bar chart shows the breakdown of employee travel behavior (Business Travel, Non-Travel, Travel Frequently, Travel Rarely). This visualization helps understand the frequency and nature of travel within the company.

4. Interactive Elements:

Filters: The presence of filter controls (e.g., Marital Status, Gender) indicates that the dashboard is interactive. Users can likely filter the data to explore specific subsets of employees and their corresponding job satisfaction, demographics, and travel patterns.
Tooltips/Details: The image suggests that hovering over data points (e.g., bars in the "Education Field" chart) would reveal more specific data, such as the exact average job satisfaction score or the precise number of employees in a particular category.
